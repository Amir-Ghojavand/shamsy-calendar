_Shamsy Calemdar CLI_

---
## Description
Shamsi Calendar CLI is a command-line tool written in Go that displays the Persian (Shamsi) calendar with support for holidays and date conversions between Gregorian and Shamsi calendars. It fetches holiday data from an external API, caches it locally, and presents the calendar in a visually appealing, color-coded format. This tool is designed for users who need to view or manage dates in the Persian calendar system, such as developers, researchers, or individuals in Iran and other Persian-speaking regions.
Features

Highlight holidays and Fridays (traditional rest days) with color-coded output.
Convert dates between Gregorian and Shamsi calendars.
Fetch and cache holiday data for a specified year from an external API.
Support for highlighting the current day when viewing the current month.
Option to list holidays for a specific month with the --show-holidays flag.
Progress bar for API requests to enhance user experience.
